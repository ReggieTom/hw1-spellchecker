## Brief Summary 

This program checks the spelling of words in a text file using a dictionary-based data structure.

The program uses three input files:
- A dictionary file containing correctly spelled words
- A text file to be checked for spelling errors
- An output file that displays the internal structure of the dictionary

First, the program reads the dictionary file and stores all words in a `Dictionary` data structure. All words are converted to lowercase, and duplicate words are ignored.

Next, the program reads the text file line by line. Each word is cleaned, converted to lowercase, and checked against the dictionary. If a word is not found, it is reported as a misspelling.

For each misspelled word, the program prints the word and the line number where it appears. Possible spelling corrections are also printed when available.

Possible corrections are generated by:
- Adding one letter
- Removing one letter
- Swapping two neighboring letters

All spelling results are printed to the terminal, and the final dictionary structure is written to the output file.

## A hard-copy of the direct output of your program 
You can use Unix’s redirecting commands to redirect the output to some text files and print out the files. I will compare this hard copy with the actual outputs of your programs. They have to be consistent.

(optional, only when you want me to check and remark your program.)
